/**
 * Represents the different types of events available in the system.

 * @remarks
 * Each base type is identified by an enum value that is divisible by 1000.
 * Enum values that are increments of a base type represent specific sub-categories.
 *
 * For example:
 * - A value of 1000 (e.g., SPORTS) is a base type.
 * - A value of 1001 (e.g., BASKETBALL) is a sub-type under the SPORTS base type.
